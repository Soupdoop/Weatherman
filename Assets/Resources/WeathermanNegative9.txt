You are a buffet of mistakes, ignoramus. It ain't that hard to read a
thermometer. If it reads 'hot' then it's gonna be hot! If it says 'cold',
then, guess what... IT'S GONNA BE COLD! And, I'll tell you what, if it don't
say either of those, then send it back to its own country! We speak English
here: something you'd think a government-subsidized weatherman would at 
least be literate in!

Learn to Read, Doofus,
