Weatherman:

I would like to extend my most gracious thanks for your most
accurate prediction of the weather yesterday. I have sent
a package containing nothing but thumbtacks to your residence,
although I have no idea when it will arrive. Please accept
these thumbtacks for the purposes of attaching things into a
wall.

Sincerely,
Pin Manhandler^
