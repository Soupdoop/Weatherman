Dear Weatherman,

	I am a local fisherman hoping to catch the fabled Holyfish in my lifetime.
	The conditions to locate this fish are very specific, and I do not possess
	the instruments to measure said conditions.

	If it would not bother you, please provide <CONDITION> for today's report.

Most gracious thanks,
Fisherman
