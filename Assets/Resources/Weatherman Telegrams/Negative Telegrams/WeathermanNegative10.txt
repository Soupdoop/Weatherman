Master Weatherman,
  
  I would've done so much good for my community today, if it weren't for 
  your meddling instruments... and your beetle too!
  
  Now my neighborhood is starving and I've lost another pair of socks!

Please, Master Weatherman, for the Sake of My Socks,

-Your Misfortunate Admirer
