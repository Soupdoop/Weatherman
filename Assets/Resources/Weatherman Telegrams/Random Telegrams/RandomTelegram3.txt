Help, Mr. Weatherman,

I am a hapless Nigerian prince, facing the last of my days. A deadly curse
has been laid upon my family, so, in order to preserve my legacy, I have
found the need to find a worthy vessel for my immortal soul. Long was
my search, and strenuous, too, given the brevity and urgency of the situation.

It is after this wild and fateful hunt, that I am messaging you. Yes, you,
Mr. Weatherman!

I just wanted to tell you that I'm still looking for that, and I'll keep you 
updated on my progress.

Heads up,

His Royalty, 

Aboammor Mansi
