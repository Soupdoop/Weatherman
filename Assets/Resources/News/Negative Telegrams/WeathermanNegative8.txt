Dear Ninny Nincompoop,

  You can't get a single thing right! The crushing pressure is making my 
  ears pop! The blazing Sun is making my eyeballs sizzle! The ferocious
  winds are ripping my flesh from bone! 

  None of that is true, of course, but who knows what will happen when
  YOU'RE predicting the weather!?

Regards,

Mr. Regards
