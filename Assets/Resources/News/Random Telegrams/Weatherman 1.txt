Dear Mr. Weatherman,

Your predecessor gained quite the legendary reputation for being a drunken sluggard. Given the extensive financial impact he had on my businesses by
ordering copious amounts of alcohol, I hope you follow in his footsteps and continue our symbiotic financial relationship.

Enclosed is a case of my finest spirits.

Sincerely,
The Bartender
