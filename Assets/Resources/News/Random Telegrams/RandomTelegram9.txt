Please!

	Please weatherman, please don't predict any more sunshine!
	If the sun keeps shining as it's been doing, I am afraid I might
	go blind! My eyesight is already much worse than when I was a 
	lad, but I do firmly believe that your incessant sun mongering
	will be the final nail in the coffin!

Please stop!
