Forecaster!

	This is Professor John Hillgensbury of Oxford University. As a renowned professor
	in the new science deemed 'climatology,' I am in great need of climate data from
	a variety of sources. Your station has been one of many selected for the purposes
	of data collection. This is an honor not given to many weather forecasters.

	Please relay <CONDITION> in your report as soon as possible.

Best of luck,
Professor John Hillgensbury^
