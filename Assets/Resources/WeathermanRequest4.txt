Weatherman of the Lighthouse:

	I am seeking guidance for my latest great work of art, entitled
	"Pastafarian Faiths, Illustrated via Fowl-Tipped Brush." However,
	the source of my divine inspirations - alcohol - has unfortunately
	been taken away from me (bar tabs and all, you know). I believe
	that you would serve as an admirable alternative inspirer for
	my masterpieces!

	As a result, I request that you send me <CONDITION> for today's report.

Respectfully,
Pablo Picarto
Legendary Artist. Eventually.^
