The End Approaches, Fool!

	Weatherman, you have failed to show up to chapel and fulfill your
	holy obligations for the past eight weeks. Your preoccupation with
	work has overshadowed everything else; in fact, did you not realize
	that the end approaches TODAY!?!?

	I must preach the end to everyone in town; however, I would like to
	be somewhat accurate when I predict how the weather will be once
	the Rapture arrives.

	Provide <CONDITION> for today's report.

Sincerely,
Priesty McPriestFace^
