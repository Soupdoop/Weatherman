Salutationse Weathermane,

  I had dressed in my most fitting of garbs for the weather you predicted.
  The weather was not as you predicted, and now I fear that my impeachment
  is imminent on the grounds that I was clothed like an imbecile for my 
  speech today.

Do Better or I'll Have Your Head on a Stake,

Hise Egregiousnesse, the Towne Mayore^
