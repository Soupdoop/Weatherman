To the Weatherman, or Whoever it may Concern:

	Hey, weatherman! You've done a bloody incredible job in predicting
	the weather! I'm sure you won't mind that I will be using you as
	the perfect result of my legendary 'Jobs R Good ©' plan! I appreciate
	that you're going to assist in my reelection run; and best of all,
	you didn't even have to work to help!

Good bloody job,
Town Mayor
