Dear Romeo,

	I have been most grievously afflicted with that terrible emotion of longing due to my separation with you!
	Please reply to my messages, or in my irrational state of mind, I will find you and murder you out of
	spite. I don't care that you've taken a so-called "restraining order" against me; what kind of legal concept
	is THAT supposed to be? Is this because of Juliet? I SWEAR TO THE HOLY TRINITY IF YOU'RE WITH JULIET I WILL HUNT YOU
	DOWN TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH

--Julia
